title: Flows and Branching models
---

Git is very flexible to adapt to different flows. The most popular one is _git-flow_,
which have been proposed by Vincent Driessen in his blog post [A successful Git branching model],
they are not absolute rules, and a good knowledge of git behaviour and a little 
of common sense will be very useful to adapt it to our necessities, and to take
advantages of a great tool as GitHub.

In another famous blog post, Scott Chacon presents [GitHub Flow], it is a basically
a simplified version of _git-flow_ adapted to environments where releases are done
too much frequently.

Some flows proposed for our projects:
<!-- We need to talk with the TLs in order to define them, and others -->

* migration-to-git Flow (because it is also important to know how to enhance 
  this documentation)
* Doppler Flow 
* Lander Flow 
* DCA Flow 

<!-- About DCA, I am not sure to include the complete Project and Client name here -->
