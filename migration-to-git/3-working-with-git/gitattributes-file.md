A `gitattributes` file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. Certain operations by Git can be influenced by assigning particular attributes to a path. 

You can find more information about how to edit git configuration in [gitattributes Manual Page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes). 

### Dealing with line endings

In order to help on [dealing with line endings](/migration-to-git/3-working-with-git/dealing-with-line-endings.html) and prepare the repository for our more common kinds of projects, we provided a recommended `.gitattributes` file that you can [see in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/MakingSense/migration-to-git/tree/gh-pages/3-working-with-git/examples/.gitattributes).
