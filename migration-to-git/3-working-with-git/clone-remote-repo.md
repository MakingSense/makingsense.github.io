title: Clone remote repo
---

Suppose that you want to work in a repository that exists in a server or in the 
cloud. You cannot commit directly there. You need a local clone of that 
repository.

GitHub recommends accessing to repositories by HTTPS URL, SSH URL is also 
available if you prefer. See [this GitHub help page][remote-url-help] if you 
have troubles with authentication.  

We will create a local repository in the folder `c:\projects\makingsense.github.io` 
cloning `https://github.com/MakingSense/makingsense.github.io`

    cd c:\projects 
	git clone https://github.com/MakingSense/makingsense.github.io.git
	cd migration-to-git

It downloads a full copy of the remote repository into the selected folder 
(.git folder), prepare the working tree and also configure a _remote_ repo 
named _origin_. In this local clone you can fetch other people commits and push yours.

If you want to work with more that one remote repository see [configure remotes].
